# Our Work

Our combustion begins at the grassroots level with free and open source software. Not only do we use it, we’re also firm believers in the openness of development and collaboration in order to make viable and sustainable products. That’s why we’re thrilled to be active contributors.

All our work is happening publicly on GitHub, and we invite everyone to join in.
